# CORE DESIGN SUMMARY - LEVEL 1 "INSTALLING THE ARCHETYPES"

## Objective

By the end of Level 1, the student should be able to:
Recognize structural category instantly (acid, tannin, body, alcohol)
Identify fruit direction (red vs black; citrus vs tropical)
Detect oak influence
Narrow a wine to the correct grape archetype ~80% of the time
Explain why other candidates are wrong
This is foundational pattern installation.

## PART 1 — CONCEPT DRILLING

Goal: Build canonical mental maps.

This phase is spatial and structural.
Students are building geometry in their heads.

### Canonical Structure Maps

#### Red Structure Map

Axes:

X = Tannin (1–5)

Y = Acidity (1–5)

All 9 red grapes are placed in fixed canonical positions.

Students:
Drag grapes onto the map
Correct misplacements
Rebuild from memory
Identify “who sits in this quadrant?”
This builds structural orientation.

#### Body & Alcohol Map

Axes:

X = Alcohol

Y = Body

Teaches:

Zinfandel = alcohol anchor

Cabernet = body anchor

Pinot = light anchor

Grenache = alcohol > tannin mismatch

Corrects common beginner confusion.

#### Flavor Direction Map (Reds)

Axes:

X = Red fruit ↔ Black fruit (from `fruit_profile`)

Y = Fruit-forward ↔ Earth/Spice/Herb (derived: `FruitForwardIndex = fruit_intensity - (earth_spice_character * 0.5) - (herbal_character * 0.5)`)

Note: `fruit_intensity` measures raw fruit expression (how much fruit is present). A grape like Syrah has high raw fruit but is NOT fruit-forward because earth/spice competes. The Y-axis captures this net perception.

Students:

Place grapes based on flavor orientation

Compare similar grapes (Merlot vs Cabernet, etc.)

#### White Structure Map

Axes:

X = Body

Y = Acidity

Separates:

Riesling

Sauvignon Blanc

Chardonnay

Oak slider overlay for Chardonnay.

### Attribute Reinforcement Drills

Short exercises:

Order by tannin

Order by acidity

Which has highest alcohol?

Which is palest in color?

Which has strongest herbal character?

These are rapid-fire structural encoding drills.

### Descriptor Matching

Students:

Match descriptors to grapes

Remove descriptors that don’t belong

Sort “black fruit” vs “red fruit”

Identify which grape owns “tar” or “pepper”

This ties structure to flavor language.

## PART 2 — PATTERN RECOGNITION GAME

Now students navigate the maps.

This is diagnostic mode.

### Structure-First Deduction

Given:

High tannin
Medium acid
Full body
Oak present

Drag top 2 candidates.

Students must reason from structure before fruit.

### Fruit-Driven Deduction

Given:

Red fruit
Medium+ acid
Herbal
Medium tannin

Candidates:

Sangiovese

Grenache

Merlot

Students eliminate and justify.

### Skeleton Mode (Harder)

No fruit.

Only structure.

Example:

Tannin 5
Acidity 5
Body 3

Correct:
Nebbiolo.

This forces reliance on canonical maps.

### Elimination Mode

Given 3–4 grapes.

Remove incorrect ones.

This trains contrast recognition.

### Map Recall Mode

Blank map.

User drags all 12 grapes into position.

This tests whether the internal coordinate system is installed.

### Tasting Mode (Optional but Powerful)

If tasting a real bottle:

User inputs sliders:

Tannin

Acid

Body

Alcohol

Oak

Fruit direction

System returns:
Top likely archetypes ranked by distance.

User confirms or revises.

This ties theory to real sensory input.

## Difficulty Scaling Within Level 1

We increase difficulty without adding nuance:

Easy:

Far-apart grapes (Cabernet vs Pinot)

Medium:

Similar tannin but different acid (Sangiovese vs Tempranillo)

Hard:

Similar structure, separated by one attribute (Merlot vs Tempranillo)

Harder:

Remove fruit clues

Remove oak clues

Add timer

Still archetypes only.

## Level 1 Mastery Criteria

Before unlocking Level 2:

80%+ structural accuracy

Correct map placement of all 12 grapes

Successful elimination reasoning

Correct identification in blind archetype simulations

Consistent performance under light time pressure

If they can’t reason structurally, they don’t move on.

## Cognitive Outcome

After Level 1, a student hears:

“High tannin, medium acid, full body, black fruit, oak.”

And immediately thinks:

Cabernet Sauvignon.

Or:

“High acid, light body, pale color.”

And thinks:

Pinot Noir.

That reflex is the goal.
