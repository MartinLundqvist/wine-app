# Backlog

## Small tweaks

- explore/styles/:id -> Make the thermal band (e.g., "moderate") render as a nicely styled badge (like the descriptors)
- / -> Add a CTA button that brings the user to the Explore page. Perhaps leverage the existing [CTA section](apps/web/src/components/landing/CTASection.tsx) for styling etc?

## Medium fixes

- The region explorer does not render well on a mobile. When clicking on a country, the details hide the map.

## Larg epics

- Build an admin UI to perform updates to the database. Should allow editing and adding wine styles, as well as configuring regions (including feature mapping to make the map render in the front-end region explorer)
