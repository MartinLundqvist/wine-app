# Backlog

## Small tweaks

## Medium fixes

- The region explorer does not render well on a mobile. When clicking on a country, the details hide the map.

## Larg epics

- Build an admin UI to perform updates to the database. Should allow editing and adding wine styles, as well as configuring regions (including feature mapping to make the map render in the front-end region explorer)
